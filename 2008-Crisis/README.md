# Objective: Efficient Frontier

#### I started by getting the historical mean returns

#### I then got the Sample covariance matrix and the efficient covariance matrix

#### The, I got covariance matrices for each sub period of the crisis (before, during, after):

#### Finally, to plot the difference and increase in risk between the three time periods, I created an efficient frontier for each
